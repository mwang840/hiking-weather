Hello and welcome to Hiking-Weather.

A react app (in Javascript this time) which makes a call to weather api and lets you know
**IF** its cool to hike outside. 
A special shoutout to @sbrugel's template for weather api, which I used for this small project.

Note The Weather.jsx I used from @sbrugel's Weather.Jsx in biking-weather as well as a bit of info.jsx file too
