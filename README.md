Hello and welcome to Hiking-Weather.

A small react app (in Javascript this time) which makes a call to weather api and lets you know
**IF** its ok to hike outside. 
Client has the ability to enter BOTH the location
A special shoutout to @sbrugel's Weather code template for weather api, which I used for this small project.
